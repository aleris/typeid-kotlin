/**
 * Kotlin implementation of <a href="https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid">TypeID</a>.
 * <p>
 * TypeIDs are a modern, type-safe, globally unique identifier based on the upcoming
 * UUIDv7 standard. They provide a ton of nice properties that make them a great choice
 * as the primary identifiers for your data in a database, APIs, and distributed systems.
 * Read more about TypeIDs in their <a href="https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid">spec</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This library provides a Kotlin implementation of TypeIDs, including the ability to
 * generate new TypeIDs, parse existing TypeIDs, and convert TypeIDs to and from strings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It uses a type-safe approach to ensure that you can't accidentally mix up TypeIDs for a specific
 * entity with TypeIDs for another entity.
 * </p>
